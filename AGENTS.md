# Coding agents guidelines for rules_xlsynth

This file documents conventions that our automated coding assistants (and human contributors!) should follow in this repository.

* **No leading blank lines** â€“ do not insert an empty line at the start of any file. The very first line must contain meaningful content, typically the SPDX license header `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` for source files.
* Additional style rules live in comments in source code and PR discussions; keep this document up-to-date when new conventions arise.
